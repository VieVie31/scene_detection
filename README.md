# GENERIC REMOVER
==================

## The Project
---------------
The goal of this project is to provide a simple interface to let people remove generics from TV shows easily.

Presently, we are able to detect commons parts video :beer: ... so, the most important part of the jobs is done.

We have tried on several series, and it seems we are on the right track !

- This project is still in development, if you want to help, do not hesitate to fork...

## How to run
--------------
First, you need docker installed on your computer. To download it go [here](https://www.docker.com/ "Docker. website").

Put all yours videos in the video/ directory and use the `sdc` command to detects the generics (--help to get help).

This command is made in python 3, so if `./scd` do not work on your system, try : `python scd`

This will download the last prerequisites (go make some coffe, you will have time) and do the magical part...


## Troubleshooting
-------------------

`apt-get` sometimes fail


## TODOS
---------

### cli
- time precision => dest fps
- size precision => dest images resolution
- web graphical interface for idiots who can't use a cli... :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
